# Coding challenge - Bobâ€™s cats

This project is a coding challenge that consists of a web page where users can view images of cats and vote for their favorite cats. Additionally, users can sort the cats by the most voted ones.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project follows a modular approach. Each module encapsulates its own functionality, including interfaces, store, services, components... For example, the Cat module contains everything related to the cat functionality:

- **Interfaces**: Defines the data structures used within the module.
- **Store**: Manages the state specific to the module.
- **Services**: Handles the business logic and API calls.
- **Components**: Contains the Vue components specific to the module.

This modular architecture helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to manage and scale the application.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**: The progressive JavaScript framework used for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Pinia**: A state management library for Vue 3, providing a simpler and more intuitive API compared to Vuex.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects, providing instant hot module replacement.
